 * ## Behaviour on transport change
 *
 *  **Wi-Fi → Cellular**:
 *   - The P2P path (LAN/STUN) may no longer be optimal.
 *   - Triggers [PeerConnectionManager.restartIce] to renegotiate ICE candidates using
 *     the new cellular interface, with up to [MAX_RESTART_ATTEMPTS] retries and
 *     exponential backoff.
 *   - During the restart: traffic bridges through the WebSocket relay so no data is lost.
 *
 *  **Cellular → Wi-Fi**:
 *   - A faster P2P path may now be available.
 *   - Attempts a P2P upgrade by triggering an ICE restart with fresh STUN candidates.
 *   - On success, the data channel takes over from the relay (path upgrade).
 *
 *  **→ Disconnected**:
 *   - No action; [PeerConnectionManager] will retry when connectivity resumes.
 *
 * ## Thread safety
 *  - All mutations run on [scope] (IO dispatcher).
 *  - The [observations] job is cancelled when [stop] is called.
 *
 * @param networkMonitor       Observes system network changes.
 * @param peerConnectionManager  Manages WebRTC [PeerConnection]s; exposes [restartIce].
