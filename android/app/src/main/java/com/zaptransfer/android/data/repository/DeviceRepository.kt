/**
 * Repository that mediates between the Room [PairedDeviceDao] and the rest of
 * the application (ViewModels, foreground service).
 *
 * Two data concerns:
 *  1. **Persistent device records** — stored in Room; exposed as [Flow] so UI
 *     layers react to additions, removals, and renames without polling.
 *  2. **Ephemeral online presence** — received from relay presence events; held
 *     in an in-memory [StateFlow] that resets on process restart. The spec
 *     (§6.7) explicitly notes presence is best-effort and not guaranteed.
 *
 * The presence set contains device IDs of devices currently reporting online
 * status via the relay. The UI overlays this with the persistent device list
 * to show green/grey indicators.
 *
 * Thread safety:
 *  - [MutableStateFlow] is safe for concurrent reads and writes.
 *  - DAO operations are suspend functions; Room dispatches them on its own executor.
 *  - [handlePresence] is not a suspend function so it can be called from OkHttp's
 *    WebSocket reader thread without launching a coroutine.
 *
 * @param dao Room DAO for paired device persistence.
