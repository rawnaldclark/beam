/**
 * Immutable audit record written once a transfer reaches a terminal state
 * (COMPLETED, FAILED, or CANCELLED).
 *
 * The record is never updated after creation — [status] transitions are
 * handled in memory by the TransferEngine and only the final state is persisted.
 * Exception: [completedAt] and [localUri] are filled in on success.
 *
 * [localUri] is a content:// or file:// URI that survives file moves — do NOT
 * store an absolute path here because the Downloads provider may rename files.
 *
 * This table is indexed by [deviceId] for fast per-device history queries,
 * and by [startedAt] DESC for the "recent transfers" list on the Device Hub.
